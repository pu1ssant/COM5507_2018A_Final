WASHINGTON EXAMINER: On Top: Best Economy in 19 Years, Highest Confidence in 14“A remarkably low 13 percent are calling President Trump’s economy a problem as confidence is hitting a 14-year high, and seven in 10 said 2018 is a good time to find a quality job. The key points from Gallup’s just-published economic survey: Economic Confidence Index at +31 in November, remaining at its highest since 2004. 55 percent rate current economic conditions positively. Record-tying 68 percent say it is a good time to find a quality job.”BLOOMBERG: U.S. Factory Production Expands for Fifth Consecutive Month“U.S. factory production expanded in October for a fifth straight month, the longest streak since 2011 and indicating a solid start to the fourth quarter, Federal Reserve data showed Friday. Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in the prior month.”THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Small-Business Confidence Stays at Near-Record High “A strong labor market and high profit trends, along with historically low inflation, are keeping small-business owners’ confidence at near-record levels, setting the stage for a strong fourth quarter, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.”CBNC: Consumer Sentiment Tops Expectations in November, Stays on Pace for Best Year Since 2000“A preliminary reading on consumer sentiment for November released on Friday came in slightly above expectations. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index hit 98.3.”CNS NEWS: Unemployment Rate at Record Low in 10 States: California, New York, Texas, Missouri, Iowa… “The unemployment rate was at a record low in ten states in October, according to data released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

No, We Don’t Need to Meet You First. “Eager employers trying to lure workers in the tightest job market since 1969 are hiring some candidates sight unseen, at times after one phone interview. The practice has become most common in seasonal work, particularly retail, although it is spreading among certain in-demand white-collar roles, such as engineers, IT professionals and teachers.”BLOOMBERG BNA: United Steelworkers Get Raise from U.S. Steel Amid Tariff Win “The union approved a new four-year agreement that includes a 14 percent wage increase over the life of the contract and strengthens benefits for members, according to a statement.

In 2016, more than 1.4 percent of our Nation’s GDP was spent funding the State and Federal criminal justice system. Victims and society at large also bear significant costs through pain, suffering, reduced quality of life, property losses, increased medical costs, and loss of life. The most recent estimates from 2014 indicate that altogether these damages constitute an additional 1.5 percent of GDP, yielding a total burden of 2.9 percent of GDP, or roughly $500 billion.These costs can be attributed, in part, to crimes committed by prisoners after already serving once in prison, through recidivism after being released from state and federal facilities. If recent trends hold, almost half of federal inmates who were conditionally released will be re-arrested within 5 years of release and more than 75 percent of state offenders who were released on community supervision will be re-arrested within 5 years of release.To break this cycle, President Donald J. Trump is working to effect bipartisan and evidence-based prison reforms to reduce recidivism. He issued an executive order in March that is bringing together more than a dozen Federal agencies to identify ways to reduce recidivism, enhance the reentry process, and improve public safety.The administration also worked with Congress to draft the FIRST STEP Act, legislation which seeks to strengthen recidivism reduction and evidence-based reentry programs for inmates in federal prisons. We continue to work with the law enforcement and faith and business communities to find ways to get people leaving prison properly reintegrated into society.…Government investment in prison education can be viewed as an extension of existing public investments — much like public investment for higher income populations through publicly financed schools, universities, and student loans — that build human capital elsewhere in our economy.The bipartisan reforms supported by the president are an important broad-based approach that will, hopefully, benefit not only prisoners, but also the American public. This White House recognizes that fiscal and human costs of criminal activity are unacceptably high. Through our efforts to break the cycle of crime and reduce recidivism, we can assist more people to contribute to our society rather than be a burden to our great country.Read the full op-ed here."

Its economic and strategic significance to Americans grows by the day.Enhancing Shared Prosperity:America has made foreign direct investments of $1.4 trillion in the Indo-Pacific region—more than Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean investments combined.President Trump’s ‘America First’ economic agenda — including deregulation, tax cuts and tax reform — also mean America is attracting more investment from the Indo-Pacific than ever before. Vice President Pence announced new initiatives that will advance fair and reciprocal trade and mobilize even greater private investment.The BUILD Act, which President Trump signed in October, doubles U.S. development finance capacity to $60 billion. This week the U.S., Japan and Australia signed a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding on development finance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.Having updated the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, the Trump Administration intends to negotiate a U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement.Through the Japan-U.S. Strategic Energy Partnership, Japan will align its $10 billion regional energy investment target with the Trump Administration’s Asia EDGE initiative.The new U.S.-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership will help municipal governments advance the digital transformation of urban systems.The U.S.-SEGA program will build capacity in APEC economies to adopt high-standard, comprehensive trade and investment policies.Ensuring a Peaceful and Secure Regional Order:Vice President Pence deepened cooperation with allies and partners on North Korean denuclearization, freedom of navigation in the East and South China Seas, and combatting terrorism and violent extremism.The United States and Japan announced delivery of ten F-35As, valued at $1.38 billion, under our Foreign Military Sales program, with six more to be delivered in 2019.The United States is providing more than half a billion dollars in security assistance to Indo-Pacific nations this year – more than double the previous year.The United States is expanding maritime security cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and the Pacific Islands.Championing Good Governance and Civil Society:Vice President Pence announced the Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative to help countries attract greater private investment, combat corruption, and secure nations’ autonomy from foreign coercion.The United States promotes sound, just, and responsive governance through efforts to counter corruption, while encouraging strong civil society and honest business practices.In conjunction with more than $400 million, the Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative will cooperate with allies, partners, and regional institutions, including ASEAN and APEC, to advance these shared principles."

And it is my great honor, on behalf on President Donald Trump, to join with Prime Minister Abe, Prime Minister Morrison, and Prime Minister Ardern in announcing the Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership that will bring electricity to 70 percent of the people of Papua New Guinea by the year 2030.Mr. Prime Minister, that is an extraordinary commitment on your part. It’s a reflection of your leadership. And I trust the people of Papua New Guinea see it as evidence of a strong commitment of the nations represented here, including the United States of America, to a brighter future for Papua New Guinea.Last year, President Trump laid out a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. And the commitment of the United States of America to this region of the world has never been stronger.And we trust that this announcement today, and the part of the United States of America in this joint announcement, is proof that America and our businesses are investing in this region as never before. This is actually the very first project under the development cooperation agreement which the United States forged with Japan and Australia last week. And we’re honored to be joined by New Zealand in bringing the expertise of our businesses and helping to deliver on your promise to bring electrification to 70 percent of your country by the end of this decade.It is remarkable to think of the impact this will have on people’s lives all across this nation. Electricity will drive economic growth. But as others have said, it will simply improve the quality of life for people all across Papua New Guinea for generations to come. And the people of the United States of America are honored to partner with you.This is a historic project. And — but be assured to my — our allies gathered here and friends all across this region, that the United States of America is going to continue to work in ways that we can build a brighter future, not just here in Papua New Guinea, but all across the Indo-Pacific for all of our people.So congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister. And to all of the leaders gathered here, it is an honor to work with you to advance the future and the opportunities of the people of Papua New Guinea. Thank you. (Applause.)END"
4,4,"Nov 18, 2018",Remarks by President Trump During Tour of Malibu Neighborhood,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-tour-malibu-neighborhood/,"Point MuguMalibu, CaliforniaNovember 17, 20184:06 P.M. PSTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And again, this is our second stop and this is incredible. We’re in Malibu — and a certain section of Malibu that was lovely. You don’t get much better than this. And you see the devastation. I guess a total, you said, of — what would you say, over 100,000 —DEPUTY CHIEF SCHULER: Just under 100,000 acres, sir.THE PRESIDENT: — over 100,000 acres, which is a tremendous amount of land. You know, 100,000 acres — people can’t envision what that is. It’s a tremendous piece of land. And it’s devastating to see it.I have to say, the government officials have done an incredible job. When you look at this devastation and, I guess, at this moment, there are — in this area, there are three deaths so far.DEPUTY CHIEF SCHULER: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Three deaths. That’s pretty incredible. It’s horrible, but it’s also pretty incredible — the job they’ve done.They evacuated very early and they took a lot of heat and they made the right decision. So I congratulate you on that because that’s a lot of political pressure on not having to do it because nobody thinks this is going to happen. They’re all unhappy, but now they’re very happy that they left. So that’s a great decision.Law enforcement, again; first responders; the military really helped a lot in both sites that we visited today. And, of course, FEMA and Brock. I think Brock has done a great job. Done a great job. So maybe I’d ask you to say a few words, Brock. Brock Long of FEMA.ADMINISTRATOR LONG: Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. President. So we’re here, not only down in Southern California but also up in Paradise. And it’s our job at FEMA to coordinate the firepower of the federal government down through the governor here to ultimately help the firefighters at the local level and police and emergency managers overcome this disaster.And so the assistance that we provide is not only going to be able to assist with the debris removal, but more importantly taking care of people. And, you know, mass care to also fire mitigation.So as you can see, as the wildfires go through an area like this, the land is scorched. And, you know, a little bit of rain is nice but too much rain could be a problem too. So we’re already trying to think ahead and work with our partners to try to mitigate what we can of the additional impacts coming. So —THE PRESIDENT: The towns and everyplace we’ve visited — I see and I’ve asked the question — they’re all going to do an expedited rebuild — meaning the permits are going to come a lot faster than would normally be the case.Actually this is an area where it’s pretty tough to get permits, and I know they’re going to go very fast with expediting and get it rebuilt and redone. And that’s a great thing. That will make things happen a lot faster.Jerry, would you like to say something?GOVERNOR BROWN: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I’ve signed an executive order to cut red tape and speed up the permit processes as well as other recovery actions. So that’ll help.And all I can say is that we are going to have to learn a lot more about nature, about the wind, about the fire potential, about how to build, how not to build, how to escape, what measures of protection we can build in.And it’s not going to be cheap but I think we have to carefully, really look into the facts here and take all that we learn and apply it going forward.And, of course, I won’t have to do that; Mr. Newsom will do that. (Laughter.) So.GOVERNOR-ELECT NEWSOM: Thanks for the baton. (Laughter.) Yeah. But I mean, it’s just, you know, the Mendocino Fire, the Tubbs Fire, the Thomas Fire — I mean, you just go down this list. And, you know, this is unaccept — I mean, we’re at a point — past a point. People have had enough of this. And we’ve got to deal with this head on.I mean, the governor has done an amazing job with the legislature the last couple of years. We’ve invested a record amount of money into our efforts, but we have to do more and this clearly underscores that.But I also want to underscore a more fundamental point and that is the collaboration and cooperation we’re getting from the federal government, and we’re very grateful for that. There’s no politics being played here.The President signed an emergency declaration immediately, and I cannot impress upon all the folks here how grateful I am for the conversations we’ve had — private, not just public — over the course of the last few hours, in terms of the expectation going forward that the federal government is not just going to be here today with all of you, but tomorrow and over the course of the next few years as we rebuild.THE PRESIDENT: That’s right. That’s true. Okay, 100 percent. We’ll get it — we’ll get it going.Would you like to say something?DEPUTY CHIEF SCHULER: I would just say, on behalf of CAL FIRE and the state fire department: Throughout California, we still remain in critical fire weather. So as this fire and the fires up north continue to gain containment, the challenge isn’t over. And through cooperation of agencies throughout California, we are successful. So thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Chief?CHIEF OSBY: All right, well, Daryl Osby. Fire chief. Los Angeles County Fire Department.On behalf of the county of Los Angeles, I just really want to thank the governor and the President here for their presence to get the state and federal resources here and support as it relates to combating this fire. Now, the — also the resources to rebuild our community.But I also just want to thank, you know, my counterpart here from CAL FIRE. And our law enforcement partner is not here but, we had all hands on deck as it relates to trying to protect this community and we were successful in getting tens of thousands of people out. And unfortunately we lost property but we saved a lot too.If you could imagine hurricane-type force winds coming through this community, that we had firefighters and sheriffs protecting the citizens here.But in conclusion, just once again, Mr. President, governor, thank you for your support. And we’re looking forward to rebuilding our communities. And then also looking forward — from the local, state, and federal level — to really talk about these challenges and what we can do to mitigate and prevent these things from occurring in the future.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Chief.Fellas?MAYOR MULLEN: Rick Mullen, mayor of the city of Malibu. And Mr. President, thank you very much for coming down here —THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MAYOR MULLEN: — and showing your concern. And also thank you for all the support you’ve given us. Governor and governor-elect, I also appreciate everything you’ve done.Malibu took it on the chin here, but compared to the fire up north, we didn’t lose as many lives. So if there’s a silver lining here, it’s that we saved a lot of lives. And we’ve paid for it in frustration for people who are outside, who got the mandatory evacuation order. So thank you for all your patience. We’re going to get you back in as quickly as possible.And for everybody who has suffered a loss here of all their personal belongings and their precious memories, we’re going to do everything that we can with the assistance of these fine gentlemen to get it back together. And we will leave no stone unturned to come together. And Malibu will be strong again.So thank you very much, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.SUPERVISOR FOY: And Mr. President, appreciate — Peter Foy Ventura County Supervisor — I just appreciate everything you’ve done. I appreciate that our fire, and — both from LA County and Ventura County — coming together to save lives, like you said.I mean, it was amazing being a part of this stuff. We’ve seen a lot of tragedy in Ventura County with the shooting, the whole bit. And I just — it’s been amazing.But we will rebuild. We will get through this. And I do appreciate, Mr. President, your prayers, your wife’s prayers, and all — and the whole country’s prayers for this community. We’re strong here in California.And I appreciate the governor and the governor-elect being here to show that support. And we are going to get through this. But it’s going to be tough and I do appreciate everything that’s happened here in Malibu too, and the rest of it. So thank you. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Peter, and all. You’ve done such a great job. And you mentioned the shootings. And we’re now going over to see some of the families of the victims and the first responders and the police and the law enforcement. Generally, the job they’ve done is really incredible. Brave.SUPERVISOR FOY: We saw Ron —THE PRESIDENT: First one in that door. Right. First one in that door. He took —SUPERVISOR FOY: He’s the hero. Yeah. And I appreciate both the governor, governor elect being at that memorial that happened.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. That’s so — it’s a beautiful memorial.SUPERVISOR FOY: So I appreciate you being out here. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: But so we’re going to go over and see them and maybe you’re going to be joining us. But we really appreciate. Great job.SUPERVISOR FOY: Well, thank you. Thank you for what you’re doing here too, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: And thank you all.DEPUTY CHIEF SCHULER: Thank you, sir.CHIEF OSBY: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.Q Mr. President, actually seeing this with your own eyes, how does that change your perception? Has it changed your perception?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it’s just a horrible thing and it’s been going on for a long time. And I think we’re going to come up with some plans and methods and mitigation. We’re going to have some great success. It’s something we can work on — do much better.I really believe — I’m a strong believer — a lot of cities are in forests — if you look at Europe and other places. We have a lot of forest states, where they’re mostly forests, and they just don’t have this problem.California is a very unique place. And it’s got some very unique leadership and some great leadership. And we’re going to be working with the leadership — working with Gavin now, for the most part. And I think we’re going to come to some pretty good conclusions and maybe, more importantly, some real solutions to a problem that is a very, very big problem.Because every year, especially at a certain time of the year, you just turn on and it’s automatic that you have these massive forest — I mean, these are massive fires.Now, in this case, when you look at where we just left, you’re talking about tremendous numbers of death. And here, we had three, I guess. At a minimum, three. That’s too much.SUPERVISOR FOY: That’s too many.THE PRESIDENT: So we’re going to work on a lot of means of mitigation and solving a problem that’s been a big problem for decades — long before Jerry, long before Gavin, long before all of us. I mean, this has been going on too long. And I think we can come up with some really great solutions.And other questions?Q Mr. President, you often talk about the fact that politics is mean business, sometimes.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it can be, but it’s very nice when we all get together.Q Yeah, I mean, and now you’re having the opportunity to have some face time —THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.Q — with people that you sometimes criticize publically. Do you feel like your relationship with them and potentially with the state of California might change because of that?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we’ve developed a very good relationship. I’ve known Jerry for a long time, but I think we got closer today than we could ever get over the last 20 years. And Gavin I’ve just met and I’ve heard terrific things, and I think we’ve developed a great relationship.We have to work together. This is a very big problem and we have to solve this problem. And I know that we’re going to work together. I have no doubt.Come here. I have no doubt, right? (Laughter.) We’re going to get it done. We have really an obligation.GOVERNOR-ELECT NEWSOM: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: I think we have an obligation.GOVERNOR-ELECT NEWSOM: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: We don’t really have a choice. We have to get it done.GOVERNOR-ELECT NEWSOM: Yep.THE PRESIDENT: And we’re going to be working together very closely.Q A lot of people agree with what you said about land management.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.Q But now another big question is, is it possible that climate change is a real issue here and that there needs to be change?THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’ll be looking at everything. I mean, it is land management and it’s forest management, really, is what you mean. But we’re going to be looking at every factor. And we’re going to get to the bottom of it. And I think we can do it fairly quickly. I really do.We’ll take the areas that are most exposed to the problem and we’ll work on that first. And you know what they are. You probably know what they are right now. But here’s an example.PARTICIPANT: Exactly. Already know what it is. Yeah, on a regular basis.THE PRESIDENT: But we’re going to come up with some really good solutions.Jennifer, did you have something?Q Yeah, Mr. President, when you said on Air Force One that you feel like you have more similarities with Governor Brown on — than we realize, did you mean on climate change or did you just mean in general?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we have similarities in many ways. And, you know, one real similarity is we both want to come to the right conclusion. And I know I get there, and I know he gets there. And the right conclusion here is to get these forest fires to stop because I really think there’s a way of doing that.And we don’t want to turn on every year — at a certain time, you turn on and it’s almost expected. And you’re watching from New York or you’re watching from Washington, D.C. and you don’t really see the gravity of it. I mean, as big as they look on the tube, you don’t see what’s going on until you come here.And what we saw at Pleasure — what a name — right now.Q Paradise.THE PRESIDENT: But when — what we just saw — we just left Pleasure —Q Paradise.THE PRESIDENT: — or Paradise — and what we just saw at Paradise is just, you know, it’s just not acceptable. You just —Q So do you think you have similarities with Governor Brown on climate change?GOVERNOR BROWN: I — let me answer that.Q Yeah, absolutely.GOVERNOR BROWN: (Laughs.) No, what I would say is, the shock of all this is going to heighten our focus and attention and also our cooperation. The President said we’re going to get to the bottom of it. There’s a short-term response, mid-term, and longer-term response. And I think we’re all going to pull together to do whatever we need.And we don’t get it all agreed to or solved in a week or a month or even a year or two. But over time, I think we’re going to get there. We’re going to understand better what we’re up against.So I would just say, Mr. President, California for 10,000 years never had more than 300,000 people. Now we got 40 million. So you got to learn to live with nature in a very creative and sophisticated way. And I think that’s going to be the challenge. I think we’ll meet it.At least, Newsom will meet it because I’m going to be watching from the ranch. (Laughter.)Q Is it going to require some new funding measure that you will seek from Congress (inaudible) —THE PRESIDENT: So we’re putting in the farm bill, $500 million. And when you look at that and, you know, when you look at the combination of the two, between Malibu and other places — I mean, not just the two; it’s other places — it sounds like a lot of money. It’s not that much money. The state will contribute. We’re all going to contribute. We’re going to get it taken care of.I mean we saw a sight — and don’t forget there are hundreds of people that still aren’t accounted for. And that’s a tough — that’s a tough situation. Now hopefully they’re with their relatives and there won’t be a problem, but certainly there will be some that are just be not accounted for.So we’re going to spend the money that — it’s necessary. Is it a — great, great people that live here and it’s unfair to put them through this so often. And Gavin knows that and Jerry knows that. We all know that. All of these folks know it and they’ve done a fantastic job. They really have.I mean, you have done, from the law enforcement standpoint, fire and fire prevention standpoint, what you’ve done is incredible. And they really held it back. This could have been far worse.And I don’t know if you know, but they’re still putting out this fire. This fire in another section. How is that going by the way?DEPUTY CHIEF SCHULER: It’s 82 percent contained.Chief.CHIEF OSBY: Yeah, we still have some hot spots and some area — canyons that’s we’re concerned about. But we think that by November 19th we’ll have full containment.THE PRESIDENT: So in Paradise they have a section that’s going absolutely wild right now with additional fire. And just by looking, Jerry, at the map, that’s a very vibrant forest that it’s right next to.GOVERNOR BROWN: Yeah, it sure is.THE PRESIDENT: And they have to — you know, they’re out there fighting. As we’re talking here, they’re throwing water, they’re doing everything you can do. There are a tremendous numbers of very brave people. And if those winds change, you know what can happen? Those people are in big trouble.So you take a look at what’s going on there and you take a look at this because right now, as we’re speaking, that’s happening. And are you going to be successful in — do you have winds coming? How long will it take to put out the rest of the fire?CHIEF OSBY: We’re pretty confident right now. We still have offshore winds, but they’ve really died down significantly.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, this is — this is good.CHIEF OSBY: You can see now that we have a marine influence and our firefighters are getting some moisture into — in this weather. So we still have several thousand firefighters out there, so we’re confident that we’ll have full containment by November the 19th.And then, as we stand here, we’re starting to repopulate the entire breadth of this incident. And then with the County of Los Angeles and surrounding cities, we’re trying to start the rehabilitation and help people get their lives back together.So that’s going to take several years working with our local officials, the county, the state, and the federal government. But once again, we appreciate your support.THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re sending a lot of extra people to Paradise. They’re going — I mean, literally, as we speak, we have massive numbers of people going up there. We have large numbers of people coming here. You have — seem to have it very much under control. Right now the wind has stopped and I assume that’s a very good thing, but the wind has stopped.But one of the problems you had, especially in Paradise, the problem you had was the wind. The wind was — I mean, they say 70 or 80 miles an hour. That’s pretty tough.Okay, any other questions?Q Mr. President, you spoke earlier today with your CIA Director, Gina Haspel —THE PRESIDENT: Yes I did.Q — in the wake of these reports that the CIA has assessed that MBS, the Crown Prince, was behind this assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. What do you believe after speaking with your CIA Director? And do you still trust the Saudi’s denials?THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I did. I spoke with our CIA Director who’s terrific and very knowledgeable and been studying this very closely. And it’s a horrible thing that took place — the killing of a journalist. A very, very bad situation. Khashoggi. And somebody who was respected. It should never have happened.And we’ll be having a very full report of the next two days. Probably Monday or Tuesday, we’ll have a very full report.Q Did the CIA assess that MBS was behind it?THE PRESIDENT: They haven’t assessed anything yet. It’s too early; that was very premature report. But that’s possible. We’re going to see. But we’re going to have a report on Tuesday and it will be very complete.In the meantime, we’re doing things to some people that we know for a fact were involved. And we’re being very tough on a lot of people.Q What’s this report on Tuesday that you just mentioned?THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to come up a report as to what we think the overall impact was and who caused it and who did it. You’re talking about a killing. We’re not talking about anything else. We’re talking about a killing. So who did it?Q What do you say to the shooting victims, Mr. President? What do you say to the shooting victims who have now —THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re going to see them right now. We’re going to see them now.Q — who have lost everything? And is there — does this think maybe there needs to be some changes when it comes to guns or things that could be done? What could be done to prevent this?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’ll tell you what, we’ll be talking to you in a little while but we’re going to see the families right now.And I hear they’ve been incredible. The families, the way they’ve handled it has been — that was a horrible, horrible event in a great area. An area that’s one of the most —SUPERVISOR FOY: Safe — one of the safest cities in America.THE PRESIDENT: — safest places, right?SUPERVISOR FOY: Yeah, safest city in America.THE PRESIDENT: I was reading it, it’s like the safest place in America and it happened there.So we’re going to see those families right now and we’ll see you back over at the airport.

(Applause.) Let’s hear it for Karen Pence everybody. Isn’t she something? (Applause.) Thank you all very much. Thanks for coming out.We just finished an eight-day journey representing the United States of America across the Indo-Pacific but we couldn’t miss the opportunity to stop here at Andersen Air Force Base, where America’s day starts every day — (applause) — among the men and women who are prepared to prevail every single day.We are proud. We are proud of the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines that are all located — and of course, Navy — give yourselves a round of applause. We’re just proud of each and every one of you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thanks for your service.I bring greetings from a great champion of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. I just saw some folks waving some flags out on his behalf. And so let me bring greetings from someone who I know would want me to let you know how proud he is of all of you. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)This (inaudible). You know, I couldn’t be — Karen already told you that, you know, my father served in combat in Korea. Her father was Air Force. We’re the proud parents of a United States Marine. I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about our armed forces, our national defense, and the families that serve alongside our armed forces.I mean, I hope you have taken note of that fact, in the first two years of this administration, we’ve made the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We’re rebuilding our military. We’re restoring the arsenal of democracy. And we also included the largest pay raise for military personnel in nearly 10 years. And you all deserve every single penny. (Applause.) I mean it.And we’re going to keep the support coming because of the sacrifices that each one of you make. You stepped forward in this all-volunteer military and you’re serving each and every day here as a vanguard of freedom in Guam. And we’re grateful to you.And, frankly, traveling cross the region as we just did, we heard from leaders around the world about their gratitude for America’s armed forces and the strength of our presence in this region and our commitment to our shared security. So it is appreciated by the people of the United States of America, but I want to assure you that our allies and our partners in the region appreciate your service as well.As Karen said, and she’s become a real national champion, we know that those of you who wear the uniform almost always do not serve alone. And so let’s hear it again for all the military spouses in the room and for the kids, and people that are making that sacrifice. (Applause.) We’re incredibly proud — incredibly proud of each and every one of you.And we want to thank you for the sacrifices that you make to be so far from home. And we, this week, realized how far you are from home. (Laughs.) It’s a long way here. And — but thank you for that. And thank you for following your families here. Thank you for the sacrifices that you’ve made.And I hope you can hear the heart of my wife Karen and just know that what she expresses is how the American people feel about those of you that wear the uniform and the families that serve alongside you each and every day. I got to tell you, the American people admire the men and women of our military and admire the families that serve alongside them. And our little family feels just the same way. And your First Family does as well.So with that, I’m going to — (inaudible). The mic went off. (Laughter.) That’s a hint. (Laughter.) I’m going to stop talking because I really would like to get around. Karen has got stuff she wants to pass out to spouses who are here. I’m like all about the selfie. (Laughter.) I’d love to get around and say a hello to as many of you as we can before we wing our way to Hawaii and back to our nation’s capital.But I know you just were served a meal. I was told there was turkey involved. How about a round of applause for the kitchen? (Applause.) Great job.And, you know, we like to spend a little bit of time in devotions together every day as a family. And we open the Good Book and there’s a great verse in there, it says, with every form of “prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” And our nation will gather to do the (inaudible) this coming Thursday. Our little family will gather. We’ll have a couple of the kids home.And — but I want you to know that this coming Thanksgiving we — we’re thankful for you. We’re thankful for what each and every one of you do to stand for freedom every day; to count the others as more important than yourselves; to put on the uniform and defend the greatest nation on Earth.And so from a grateful nation, a grateful Commander-in-Chief, and a grateful Second Family, we say from our hearts, from our family to yours, happy Thanksgiving. And God bless you all. (Applause.)END"

PSTGOVERNOR BROWN: I’ll just say a few words. We all know of how tragic this has been, and I find it very hard to find just the right way to put it. People are really working hard. People have suffered. And so many people from so many different places and backgrounds and services have pulled together.And I can say: Thanks to the firefighters and first responders, and thanks to the federal government. FEMA has been terrific. And I really appreciate the President himself being here and putting the focus and the spotlight on probably the worst tragedy that California has ever faced, at least from a fire situation.President Trump.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Jerry. And I just want to also thank FEMA; law enforcement — you folks have been incredible; first responders; the firefighters. They’re out there now. They want to be — you know, got a lot of territory to cover.Still going very heavily. There’s a big area of very intense flame right now that’s next to a very explosive area, wouldn’t you say? I mean, it’s a very — it’s a very big problem out there going. And they’re fighting and they’re fighting like hell.We’ve never seen anything like this. In California, we’ve never seen anything like this, Jerry. It’s like total devastation.But again, I want to thank everybody. And Brock is going to give you a little presentation as to where we’re going, what we’re doing, and how we’re doing it.But again, the men and women that are fighting this fire are incredible. You know that more than 70 people are lost, are gone. And we’re looking for hundreds of people right now. There are literally hundreds that they’re looking for.And hopefully that’s going to be a good conclusion instead of a bad conclusion. Maybe they left and maybe they’re with their loved ones somewhere else and we just don’t know about it. But they’re looking for hundreds of people. And we’ll know the answer to that over the next 48 hours, I think — for the most part.Brock, perhaps you could give a little bit of a presentation as to how we’re going to stop the rest of this monster.ADMINISTRATOR LONG: Yes, sir. So, Mr. President, as we’ve discussed, this is probably the worst disaster that I’ve seen in my career. And it’s going to take a partnership at all levels of government — not only, you know, helping the governor achieve his response and recovery goals, but also it’s the time for neighbor helping neighbor. That’s what’s most important.FEMA is on the ground. I’ve been here since Tuesday making sure that we have full situational awareness on how to help the state achieve what needs to be done when it comes to the firefighting, but also the — you know, the taking care of people part, the mass-care issues.So we have set up disaster recovery centers. We’re also asking people to call1-800-621-FEMAor to goDisasterAssistance.govto register. To this point, as of this morning, I think we’ve had over 12,000 people already registered into our assistance system. And we’ve handed out close to $3 million directly to those who have qualified for assistance.Obviously, the firefighting is the main priority and taking care of people and making sure that we can get people transitioning out of shelters into longer-term homes. And then we’re also working with Mark Ghilarducci in the state of California, who has done a tremendous job making sure that we help him understand how we’re going to do debris removal and get the infrastructure back up so that we can start to help communities like Concow and Paradise strive for a new normal.So with that, I think it’s time for us to turn it over to the incident commander. So he’s fighting the fire.MR. RUSSELL: Mr. President, if I could turn you to this. So this is a progression map of the fire. The blue was the very first day, when we experienced the most significant damage. Obviously it went almost 55,000 acres within the first 12 hours and then almost 8,000 structures were burned in that time.So (inaudible) Concow to Paradise (inaudible) were all part of that. There are still significant challenges (inaudible) river drainage and the weather we’re receiving there, the winds, and the red-flag warning that is still coming this weekend along —THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.)MR. RUSSELL: Absolutely. This whole area, especially in the river drainage. And there’s still communities (inaudible) Creek and other areas outside the burn areas that we are concerned about.THE PRESIDENT: Well, good luck.MR. RUSSELL: Thank you very much, sir.THE PRESIDENT: You’re welcome. (Inaudible.) Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you.Q Mr. President, do you see any role of climate change in the — in these fires that we’ve seen in California recently?THE PRESIDENT: Say it.Q The role of climate change in these fires in California?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think you have a lot of factors. We have the management factor that I know Jerry has really been up on and very well. And Gavin is going to — we’re going to be looking at it together. And right now that seems to be a very big problem. And we’re going to get that problem solved.In the farm bill, we’re putting quite a bit of money — about $500 million — in the farm bill for management and maintenance of the forests beyond this area. But really, management — $500 million. That will be in the farm bill. We just put it in. The farm bill is moving along pretty rapidly for our great farmers. But we have a new category and that’s management and maintenance of the forests. It’s very important.I want to thank you folks over there. Right there. Law enforcement. Great. Great job. (Applause.)Q Does seeing this devastation, though, change your opinion at all on climate change, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: No. No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate. We’re going to have that. And we’re going to have forests that are very safe because we can’t go through this every year. We go through this — and we’re going to have safe forests. And that’s happening as we speak — as we speak.Q You said the fire — you said there needs to be changes with fire management. Should the state and local officials have done (inaudible)?THE PRESIDENT: No, we’re going to work together with the federal government. No — state, local, and federal government. Federal government is going to work with the state and local, and we’re going to help them with funding. And we’re going to take — it’s going to take a lot of funding, I will tell you that.Q Should they have done things differently before this point?THE PRESIDENT: A lot of things have been learned. A lot of things have been learned. And they’ve been working very hard and I think you’re going to see something very spectacular over the next number of years.GOVERNOR BROWN: I think if you really look at the facts, through a very open point of view, there are a lot of elements to be considered. And the President came, he saw, and I’m looking forward over the next months — and even beyond — to really understand this threat of fire, the whole matter of drought, and all the rest of it.And it’s not one thing; it’s a lot of things. I think if we just open our minds and look at things, we’ll get more stuff done.THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.END 12:44 P.M. PST"
7,7,"Nov 17, 2018",The Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/papua-new-guinea-electrification-partnership/,"Papua New Guinea has invited Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States to work together to support its enhanced connectivity and the goal of connecting 70% of its population to electricity by 2030. Currently only about 13% of Papua New Guinea’s population have reliable access to electricity.Access to electricity is key to Papua New Guinea’s economic growth. Electricity lifts the living standards of communities in cities, towns and remote villages. It allows schools and hospitals to deliver essential services. It is also an essential precursor for the growth of the private sector and industry, including small and medium enterprises.Progress towards Papua New Guinea’s ambitious objectives will require large scale investment by both the public and private sectors. This includes investment in new generation capacity as well as transmission and distribution lines to connect households, service providers and businesses to the grid. Continued efforts to improve institutional and regulatory frameworks are also required in order to unlock private investment.Papua New Guinea, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States intend to join together in a Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership in support of Papua New Guinea’s objectives for electrification. This high level partnership forms part of the enduring economic and security partnership between [our countries]. This initiative will also be open to other partners that support principles and values which help maintain and promote a free, open, prosperous and rules based region.The Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership is intended to focus on the importance of principles-based, sustainable infrastructure development that is transparent, non-discriminatory, environmentally responsible, promotes fair and open competition, upholds robust standards, meets the genuine needs of the people of Papua New Guinea and avoids unsustainable debt burdens. It is intended to adopt a strong focus on investments that provide employment and training opportunities for local contractors and communities. It is also intended to focus not only on delivering high impact investments but ensuring improved coordination and governance within the energy sector.Importantly, this initiative represents a true partnership between Papua New Guinea and its key partners to drive growth and development for communities throughout Papua New Guinea. The partnership is intended to be delivered in alignment with Papua New Guinea’s own plans and priorities and implemented in close conjunction with PNG Power Limited.The Prime Ministers of Papua New Guinea (O’Neill), Australia (Morrison), Japan (Abe), New Zealand (Ardern), and the Vice President of the United States Mike Pence hereby sign this Joint Statement to mark the announcement of this new multi-country initiative at APEC House on 18 November 2018. The announcement signals a strong commitment from these countries to supporting growth enabling investment in key economic infrastructure in Papua New Guinea."

ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Hey everybody. So we’re going to California. We’re making two stops. We’re going to the two areas that you know very well. And it’s a shame; it seems that many more people are missing than anyone thought even possible. And I want to be with the firefighters and the FEMA and first responders.We’ll be spending a lot of time. We’ll be coming back here — probably landing at four o’clock in the morning or something like that. But we want to spend a lot of time. We want to discuss many things. I’m meeting with the governor and the new governor — and governor-elect. So we have a lot of things to talk about.We will be talking about forest management. I’ve been saying that for a long time. And this could have been a lot different situation. But the one thing is that everybody now knows that this is what we have to be doing, and there’s no question about it. It should have been done many years ago, but I think everybody is on the right side.It’s a big issue. It’s a big issue. A very expensive issue, but very, very inexpensive when you compare it to even one of these horrible fires. And it will save a lot of lives, in addition to a lot of money.So we’ll be out there talking to the governors, talking to the first responders and FEMA. They have been incredible. The firefighters have been unbelievably brave. Some of the stories I’ve read last night — unbelievably brave. Okay?Q (Inaudible) the murder?THE PRESIDENT: Well, we haven’t been briefed yet. The CIA is going to be speaking to me today. We have not been briefed yet. As of this moment, we were told that he did not play a role. We’re going to have to find out what they have to say.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: Say it.Q Have you submitted your answers to the special counsel?THE PRESIDENT: No, we do that next week. They’re all done.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.Q (Inaudible) Crown Prince held responsible for this?THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re taking a look at it. You know, we also have a great ally in Saudi Arabia. They give us a lot of jobs. They give us a lot of business, a lot of economic development. They are — they have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development. And I also take that — you know, I’m President; I have to take a lot of things into consideration.So we will be talking with the CIA later and lots of others. I’ll be doing that while I’m on the plane. I’ll be speaking also with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: We have not been talking, no. We haven’t. We have not been talking about it. We’ll see.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: No, it’s not under consideration. We are looking — always looking. And whatever we can do for Turkey and, frankly, countries that we get along with very well — we’re having a good moment with Turkey. As you know, he gave Pastor Brunson back last week, and we appreciate that.We are doing very well with Turkey. I get along very, very well with the President. He’s a friend of mine. He’s a strong man, he’s a tough man, and he’s a smart man. But he’s a friend of mine. And whatever we can do, we’ll do. But — and that is something that we’re always looking at. But at this point, no.Q Mr. President, are you (inaudible) Mueller (inaudible)?THE PRESIDENT: What?Q (Inaudible) Robert Mueller now?THE PRESIDENT: We haven’t even talked about it.Q (Inaudible) to the southern border?THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we have a tremendous military force on the — on the border — on the southern border. We have large numbers of people trying to get into our country. I must say, the reason it’s increased so much is because we’re doing so well, as opposed to the rest of the world. And if you look at south of our border, it’s not doing so well.But regardless, we have millions of people on line to get into our country legally, and those people have preference. They have to have preference. They’ve been waiting for a long time. They’ve done it legally.So we have a lot of things happening, but we have a great military force on the southern border. We’re not letting people into our country illegally. And we’re not doing a release. We’ll do a catch, but we’re not doing releases. So if they think they’re going to be released into our country like in the old days — like for years and years, they catch and release — we’re not releasing. They don’t get released.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: What?Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: As long as necessary. They built great fencing. They built a very powerful fence — a different kind of a fence. It’s been very powerful. The fence is fully manned. Nobody gets through. And when they’re caught, they’re not released.And it’s very interesting — I said it this morning — they come up and they’re talking about all their great fear, all their problems with their country, but they’re all waving their country’s flag. What is that all about? If they have such fear and such problems and they hate their country, why do we see all the flags being waved for Guatemala, for Honduras, for El Salvador? We’re seeing flags all over the place. Why are they waving flags? This has nothing to do with asylum; this has to do with getting into our country illegally. And we have to know who wants to come into our country.Okay.Q (Inaudible) Vice President Mike Pence (inaudible) questioned on his loyalty?THE PRESIDENT: No, I don’t question his loyalty at all. He’s a 100 percent loyal. This is a phony story. I doubt they had any sources. A typical New York Times phony story.Mike Pence is 100 percent. Not even a doubt of that entered my mind. He’s been a trooper. He’s been with me from — as soon as I won the primaries. I mean, he was the one I chose, and I could not be happier. And I don’t question his loyalty at all. He’s already been tested, in many ways. Mike Pence is a terrific person.That was a phony story written by the New York Times who, by the way, never called me for a comment. How do you do a story like that? See, it’s fake news. And that’s what breaks up the country. Fake news. How do you do a story like that and you don’t call the principal? I would give them a quote. I would say it’s not true and that’s the end of their story.But they don’t do that. They write and then they make up sources. They may speak to one person, but they make up phony sources. They make — like you write a novel. Have you ever written a novel? That’s the way a lot of the news stories — you look, that’s why I call it “fake news.” It’s fake. And it’s a very bad thing for our country. It’s very dangerous.Mike Pence is 100 percent. They should retract that story. But you can’t do that story without calling me for a quote. Or you could call Sarah Huckabee, and say, “Can I get a quote?” And here she is. “Can I get a quote from the President?” I would be happy to give a quote. I would be happy. And you know what the quote would be? “Mike Pence is 100 percent.” Now you can’t do your story. So that’s why they don’t like calling me for a quote.Q (Inaudible) with Nancy Pelosi?THE PRESIDENT: I would help Nancy Pelosi if she needs the votes. She may need some votes. I will perform a wonderful service for her. I like her. Can you believe it? I like Nancy Pelosi. I mean, she’s tough and she’s smart. But she deserves to be Speaker.And now they’re playing games with her just like they’ll be playing with me with — it’s called “presidential harassment.” The President of your country is doing a great job, but he’s being harassed. It’s presidential harassment. Well, in a way, her own party is harassing her because nobody else should be Speaker.Now, that doesn’t mean for a hundred years. But definitely, they should start off with Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. And I already have a lot of votes. If she needs any votes, if she asks me, I will give her the votes to put her over the top.Q (Inaudible) Republicans would vote for her?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I saw Tom Reed as an example. He’s a fine man — a congressman. I would call him a moderate. I’m not saying I can get them from the super conservative side, but maybe I even get them from there. But I don’t imagine she would need too many, but whatever number of votes she needs — if it’s 50, or 10, or 2, or 1 — she’s got them from me, automatic.So tell her opposition they’re wasting their time.Q Mr. President, are you going to shutdown if don’t get funding for your border wall?THE PRESIDENT: We’re talking about the boarding wall — the border wall. We’re talking about quite a big sum of money, about $5 billion. And I think, probably, if I were ever going to do a shutdown over border security — when you look at the caravan, when you look at the mess, when you look at the people coming in — this would be a very good time to do a shutdown.I don’t think it’s going to be necessary because I think the Democrats will come to their senses. And they don’t come to their senses, we will continue to win elections. You know, we won the Senate. You do recognize, right? That means all the judges that I’m getting approved will now be easier because we actually pick up — which is a start — we picked up two seats in the Senate. We went from 51-49 to 53-47. That’s a tremendous difference. And these are senators I really like. That’s also a difference.Thank you all very much. Thank you.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: What?Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: I have very close to made a decision on U.N. Ambassador. On Attorney General: No, we haven’t. But I will tell you, until that decision is made, we have a great gentleman in Matt Whitaker. And everybody tells me he’s doing a fantastic job.Q Have you considered Pam Bondi for any administration positions?THE PRESIDENT: I’d consider Pam Bondi for anything, but right now we — I know her very well. In the meantime, she’s got a very good job. She’s doing a very good job. She’s always done a very good job. But at some form — in some form, I’d love to have her in the administration.But we have great people. You know, we have tremendous people — our Cabinet. I’m very happy. Now will I make adjustment? Yes. But we have a great Cabinet.You take a look at what we’re doing with the military. Very happy with Secretary of Defense, by the way. Jim Mattis is doing a great job. Mike Pompeo is doing a great job. We have a truly great Cabinet. I could go through every one of them, but then you might be able to figure out the one or two that I’m a little bit less happy with. That wouldn’t be good.Okay, thank you. I’ll see you California. Thank you.Q (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to be looking at everything. Thank you.END  7:36 A.M. EDT"
