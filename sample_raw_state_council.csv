Measures to improve education, infrastructure and the regulatory environment would help make digitalization “an even more important engine of growth in the near future,” he noted.The outlook of the region’s digital economy is promising. By 2021, the digital transformation would add an estimated $1.16 trillion to Asia Pacific’s GDP, according to a business research produced by Microsoft in partnership with IDC Asia/Pacific early this year.As a leading innovator and investor in digital technologies, China is playing a dynamic role in driving the region’s digital economy growth.China’s digital economy reached 27.2 trillion yuan (about $3.9 trillion) in 2017, up 20.3 percent year-on-year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The digital economy accounted for 32.9 percent of the country’s GDP last year, 2.6 percentage points higher than the previous year.E-commerce is one of the fastest growing sectors. The current value of China’s e-commerce transactions is estimated to be larger than in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States combined, according to a report from the McKinsey Global Institute.China has promised to share the opportunities of the digital economy with other nations for inclusive and more sustainable growth.“It [China] is already shaping the global digital landscape and supporting and inspiring entrepreneurship far beyond its own borders,” the McKinsey report said, noting that China’s outbound venture capital totaled 38 billion dollars in the 2014-2016 period, up from 6 billion dollars in 2011-2013.Chinese technology giants like Alibaba and Huawei have expanded their presence in Asia Pacific countries including Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, offering digital services such as mobile payment and e-trade platforms and providing internet infrastructure to create jobs and momentum for the local economy.“Digital economy means an open economy. It has no future without opening up. China views the digital economy as a common opportunity for global development,” said Zhuang Rongwen, director of the Cyberspace Administration of China.“We are willing to deepen cooperation with other countries to further promote the digital economy and make a bigger cake of development through cross-border e-commerce and open markets,” Zhuang said."

2,2,2,2018/11/20,Key tunnel of Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway network finished,http://english.gov.cn/news/top_news/2018/11/20/content_281476398512740.htm,"The drilling of Qinghuayuan tunnel was completed on Nov 20 in Beijing, an important progress for the Beijing-Zhangjiakou intercity high-speed railway construction to move ahead smoothly.The tunnel, which began to be built in November, is located in Haidian district, extending underground from the Beijing North Railway Station for 6,020 meters before going aboveground to the north. Its diameter reaches 12.64 meters.The Qinghuayuan tunnel went through three subway lines, seven crucial city roads and 88 municipal pipelines. It is a shield tunnel at the city center, passing through some of the most complex underground layers and most important buildings.Shield tunneling can minimize the destruction of current fundamental construction features such as roads, pipelines, pedestrian overpasses and bus stations, and also reduce noise pollution and the interference to people and residential communities.On Nov 11, the drilling of nearly 13-kilometer-long tunnel on high-speed railway network for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Zhangjiakou, North China’s Hebei province, was completed. The construction of the tunnel, the longest on Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway route, began in September 2016 and was named Zhengpantai tunnel.The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway has a total length of 174 kilometers with 10 stops, which is the first ballast track with maximum speed of 350 km/h, able to pass through Alpine regions and sandstorm areas, according to the Beijing Railway Administration.The project is scheduled for completion by the end of 2019 and will shorten the trip between the two cities from the current three hours to just one hour.It is a vital transportation construction for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games co-hosted by Beijing and Zhangjiakou."

The mountain range includes 12 nature reserves.Hailing the construction of the Shaanxi segment of the park, Wang Lei, who has photographed pandas for 15 years, said the move would facilitate coordinated panda management in the reserves.Before the park was established, each reserve worked on its own, and that wasn’t good for panda conservation, he said.Planning for Giant Panda National Park began in January last year, when the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council issued a circular on the project.The park covers 27,134 sq km, 20,177 sq km of which are in Sichuan province, 2,571 sq km in Gansu province and 4,386 sq km in Shaanxi.The Sichuan portion of the park is in the Minshan, Qionglai and Daxiangling mountains; the Shaanxi portion is in the Qinling Mountains; and the Gansu portion is in the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve.Speaking at the plaque-unveiling ceremony of the administrative bureau of the Giant Panda National Park in Chengdu, Sichuan, in October, Li Chunliang, deputy chief of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, said establishing the park in the main habitats of the giant panda is of great importance in protecting the ecosystem, as well as biodiversity with the giant panda as the core.The park is expected to help wild pandas that are isolated on mountains across Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces to breed, strengthening their gene pool, said Zhang Hemin, deputy chief of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan.More than 80 percent of the world’s wild pandas live in Sichuan, with the rest in Shaanxi and Gansu.China’s fourth panda census in 2015 showed that only 1,864 pandas live in the wild."
